Q&A

Q. What is Naomi’s flaw?
A. Currently, I don’t know. 

Characters:
Narrator: Ted. Theodore. 38

Ted’s an unreliable narrator. His journey is originally trying to figure Abram out, to fearing him, to despising him, to respecting him. 

Ted is self absorbed. He thinks the world will hand him things, because it has for his entire life. He is over-confident. 

Naomi: Naomi is going to leave. He’s going to kick Naomi out. Naomi isn’t perfect.

Abram: 43 Did the thing. He made a choice that landed him where he is at. He’s deeply sad about it, but it was better than the alternative, so he doesn’t regret it. It is tearing him apart.

He also has good habits.
